## DogeyBot

The ~~second~~ third iteration of DogeyBot. The original DogeyBot and the second version were in NodeJS.
Now, it's Python, a language I actually understand.
People were really sad when I pulled the plug on DogeyBot before this one. (Who is sad for a bot they don't even use??)

## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/DogeyStamp/DogeyBot/`
- Add the Discord bot token to dogeytoken.py using your favourite text editor and the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)
